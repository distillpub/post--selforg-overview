        <p>
            Self-organisation is omnipresent on all scales of biological life 
            - from the complex interactions between molecules to form structures such as proteins, 
            to cell colonies interacting to achieve larger goals such as exploration, to animal cells self-organising into bodies, 
            to humans forming collectives in society such as tribes, governments or countries. 
            The old adage “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”, often ascribed to Aristotle, rings true everywhere we look. 
            We see emergent properties in many complex systems, even if these are governed by very simple rules or agents at heart 
            - whether it’s flocking in birds or collective intelligence in humans. 
        </p>


        <p>
            The articles in this thread investigate ways to elicit and steer similar emergent behaviour “on silicon” 
            - with the goal of understanding how to design robust and general purpose selof-organizing systems.
        </p>


        <!--<p>
            Complex structures in nature form in a way that’s drastically different from those human’s create.
            Global order emerges from local interactions between tiny constituent particles -- a process called self-organization.
            These self-organizing systems can be remarkably flexible and robust.
            As a result, there’s been significant research interest in engineering self-organizing systems, but it remains an open research topic.
        </p>-->       
 


        <h2>Articles & Comments</h2>

        <p>
          Distill has invited several researchers to publish a “thread” of short articles exploring differentiable self-organizing systems,
          interspersed with critical commentary from several experts in adjacent fields.
          The thread will be a living document, with new articles added over time.
          Articles and comments are presented below in chronological order:

                    This article investigates morphogenesis - 
                    the process by which living creatures self-assemble their bodies. 
                    It explores a simple, differentiable, model of morphogenesis inspired by cellular automata 
                    and shows how such a model can learn a robust and persistent set of dynamics

                    Building on the previous article, this article explores whether neural cellular automata can be used for a different goal:
                      self-classification. 
                     The authors make some tweaks to the original paradigm and show that a similar model can be used to have cells 
                     self-classify the MNIST digit they form - with good generalization and exhibiting both spatial, temporal and scale invariance.

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    
        <p>
          The Self-Organizing systems thread is open to articles exploring differentiable self-organizing sytems. 
          Critical
          commentary and discussion of existing articles is also welcome. The thread
          is organized through the open <code>#selforg</code> channel on the
          <a href="http://slack.distill.pub">Distill slack</a>. Articles can be
          suggested there, and will be included at the discretion of previous
          authors in the thread, or in the case of disagreement by an uninvolved
          editor.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          If you would like get involved but don't know where to start, small
          projects may be available if you ask in the channel.
        </p>
    
        <h2>About the Thread Format</h2>
    
        <p>
          Part of Distill's mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific
          publishing. We believe that that reconciling faster and more continuous
          approaches to publication with review and discussion is an important open
          problem in scientific publishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Threads are collections of short articles, experiments, and critical
          commentary around a narrow or unusual research topic, along with a slack
          channel for real time discussion and collaboration. They are intended to
          be earlier stage than a full Distill paper, and allow for more fluid
          publishing, feedback and discussion. We also hope they'll allow for wider
          participation. Think of a cross between a Twitter thread, an academic
          workshop, and a book of collected essays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Threads are very much an experiment. We think it's possible they're a
          great format, and also possible they're terrible. We plan to trial two
          such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.

      <h3>Editorial Note</h3>
      <p>
          Part of Distill's mandate is to experiment with new forms of scientific publishing.
          We believe something along the lines of this "thread" format might be promising,
          but see it very much as an experiment.
          We plan to trial two such threads and then re-evaluate our thought on the format.
